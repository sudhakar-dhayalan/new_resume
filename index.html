      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="angularJs-image" src="img/angularJs.jpg" alt="angularJs-image">
        <!-- <h3>AngularJs</h3> -->
        <p>Being involved in AngularJs development for over a period of two years, I had worked and fixed lots and lots of defects, created module and helped my
          peers which includes seniors also ( from the month of may 2020 where I found myself comfortable in doing difficult tasks )</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="angular-image" src="img/angular.png" alt="angular-image">
        <!-- <h3>Angular</h3> -->
        <p>This I learnt by myself through udemy course. Concepts was really easy for me as I had good knowledge in AngularJs, which I believe made me to learn this
          easily. When you learnt and so good in one language, it becomes easy to do the same in other languages right ?
          Devleoped 3-4 applications on my own, which was simple but foundation was strong. Will
          develop more apps in Angular</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="typescript-image" src="img/typescript.png" alt="typescript-image">
        <!-- <h3>TypeScript</h3> -->
        <p>This is the basics for Angular which has the concepts of ES6 and I already know it which made the learning of TypeScript so easy. The part that I like on
          this is whenever I get struck I can get it resolved by myself</p>

        <p>This is what you're looking at, from which you can analyse how good I am in this. I had to admit that I was not an expert in this but started practising
          and I am on the path to achieve excellency</p>
